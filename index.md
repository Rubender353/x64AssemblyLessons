## Lesson 1

Hello, world!

First, some background
Assembly language is bare-bones. The only interface a programmer has above the actual hardware is the kernel itself. In order to build useful programs in assembly we need to use the linux system calls provided by the kernel. These system calls are a library built into the operating system to provide functions such as reading input from a keyboard and writing output to the screen.

When you invoke a system call the kernel will immediately suspend execution of your program. It will then contact the necessary drivers needed to perform the task you requested on the hardware and then return control back to your program.

Note: Drivers are called drivers because the kernel literally uses them to drive the hardware.

We can accomplish this all in assembly by loading RAX (EAX in x86 32-bit) with the function number (operation code OPCODE) we want to execute and filling the remaining registers with the arguments we want to pass to the system call. A software interrupt in 32-bit is requested with the INT instruction and the kernel takes over and calls the function from the library with our arguments. In 64-bit it will use 32 bit registers, so we will need to use syscall interrupt in 64-bit assembly. [Click here to learn more about int 80h and syscall](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46087730/what-happens-if-you-use-the-32-bit-int-0x80-linux-abi-in-64-bit-code)

For example requesting an interrupt when RAX=60 will call sys_exit and requesting an interrupt when RAX=1 will call sys_write instead. EBX, ECX & EDX is now RBX,RCX, & RDX in 64-bit x64. RBX,RCX, & RDX will be passed as arguments if the function requires them. [Click here to view an example of a 64-bit Linux System Call Table and its corresponding OPCODES.](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/constants/syscalls.md#x86_64-64_bit)

The biggest difference from 32-bit is that after RAX 6 registers get used sequentially as parameters. After that other registers will be put on stack. In 32-bit you could write hello world using RBX register to store stuff in it. In 64-bit we now need to keep in mind the 6 parameters passed by register. Which are RDI,RSI,RDX,RCX,R8, and R9.

Keep in mind I will be using Linux specifically Ubuntu. Depending on your architecture and ABI used these may be called differently. So if using nasm for some other device refer to their documentation, calling tables, and ABI info.

Register	Value
RAX	System call number
RDI	1st argument
RSI	2nd argument
RDX	3rd argument
RCX	4th argument
R8	5th argument
R9	6th argument

Writing our program
Firstly we create a variable 'msg' in our .data section and assign it the string we want to output in this case 'Hello, world!'. In our .text section we tell the kernel where to begin execution by providing it with a global label _start: to denote the programs entry point.

We will be using the system call sys_write to output our message to the console window. This function is assigned OPCODE 4 in the x86 Linux System Call Table. In x64 we will user OPCODE 1. The function also takes 3 arguments which are sequentially loaded into RDI, RSI and RDX before requesting a software interrupt which will perform the task.

The arguments passed are as follows:

RDX will be loaded with the length (in bytes) of the string.
RSI will be loaded with the address of our variable created in the .data section.
RDI will be loaded with the file we want to write to â€“ in this case STDOUT.
The datatype and meaning of the arguments passed can be found in the function's definition.
We compile, link and run the program using the commands below.

### Hello World Code

```
; Hello World Program - 64-bit
; Compile with: nasm -f elf64 helloworld.asm
; Link with : ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld.o -o helloworld
; Run with: ./helloworld
 
SECTION .data
msg     db      'Hello World!', 0Ah     ; assign msg variable with your message string
 
SECTION .text
global  _start
 
_start:
 
    mov     rdx, 13     ; number of bytes to write - one for each letter plus 0Ah (line feed character)
    mov     rsi, msg    ; move the memory address of our message string into ecx
    mov     rdi, 1      ; write to the STDOUT file
    mov     rax, 1      ; invoke SYS_WRITE (kernel opcode 1)
    syscall
```
```
~$ nasm -f elf64 helloworld.asm
~$ ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld.o -o helloworld
~$ ./helloworld
Hello World!
