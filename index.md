## Lesson 1

Hello, world!

First, some background
Assembly language is bare-bones. The only interface a programmer has above the actual hardware is the kernel itself. In order to build useful programs in assembly we need to use the linux system calls provided by the kernel. These system calls are a library built into the operating system to provide functions such as reading input from a keyboard and writing output to the screen.

When you invoke a system call the kernel will immediately suspend execution of your program. It will then contact the necessary drivers needed to perform the task you requested on the hardware and then return control back to your program.

Note: Drivers are called drivers because the kernel literally uses them to drive the hardware.

We can accomplish this all in assembly by loading RAX (EAX in x86 32-bit) with the function number (operation code OPCODE) we want to execute and filling the remaining registers with the arguments we want to pass to the system call. A software interrupt in 32-bit is requested with the INT instruction and the kernel takes over and calls the function from the library with our arguments. In 64-bit it will use 32 bit registers, so we will need to use syscall interrupt in 64-bit assembly. [Click here to learn more about int 80h and syscall](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46087730/what-happens-if-you-use-the-32-bit-int-0x80-linux-abi-in-64-bit-code)

For example requesting an interrupt when RAX=60 will call sys_exit and requesting an interrupt when RAX=1 will call sys_write instead. EBX, ECX & EDX is now RBX,RCX, & RDX in 64-bit x64. RBX,RCX, & RDX will be passed as arguments if the function requires them. [Click here to view an example of a 64-bit Linux System Call Table and its corresponding OPCODES.](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/constants/syscalls.md#x86_64-64_bit)

The biggest difference from 32-bit is that after RAX 6 registers get used sequentially as parameters. After that other registers will be put on stack. In 32-bit you could write hello world using RBX register to store stuff in it. In 64-bit we now need to keep in mind the 6 parameters passed by register. Which are RDI,RSI,RDX,RCX,R8, and R9.

Keep in mind I will be using Linux specifically Ubuntu. Depending on your architecture and ABI used these may be called differently. So if using nasm for some other device refer to their documentation, calling tables, and ABI info.

Writing our program
Firstly we create a variable 'msg' in our .data section and assign it the string we want to output in this case 'Hello, world!'. In our .text section we tell the kernel where to begin execution by providing it with a global label _start: to denote the programs entry point.

We will be using the system call sys_write to output our message to the console window. This function is assigned OPCODE 4 in the x86 Linux System Call Table. In x64 we will user OPCODE 1. The function also takes 3 arguments which are sequentially loaded into RDI, RSI and RDX before requesting a software interrupt which will perform the task.

The arguments passed are as follows:

RDX will be loaded with the length (in bytes) of the string.
RSI will be loaded with the address of our variable created in the .data section.
RDI will be loaded with the file we want to write to â€“ in this case STDOUT.
The datatype and meaning of the arguments passed can be found in the function's definition.
We compile, link and run the program using the commands below.

### Hello World Code

```
; Hello World Program - 64-bit
; Compile with: nasm -f elf64 helloworld.asm
; Link with : ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld.o -o helloworld
; Run with: ./helloworld
 
SECTION .data
msg     db      'Hello World!', 0Ah     ; assign msg variable with your message string
 
SECTION .text
global  _start
 
_start:
 
    mov     rdx, 13     ; number of bytes to write - one for each letter plus 0Ah (line feed character)
    mov     rsi, msg    ; move the memory address of our message string into ecx
    mov     rdi, 1      ; write to the STDOUT file
    mov     rax, 1      ; invoke SYS_WRITE (kernel opcode 1)
    syscall
```
```
~$ nasm -f elf64 helloworld.asm
~$ ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld.o -o helloworld
~$ ./helloworld
Hello World!
Segmentation fault
```

## Lesson 2
Proper program exit

Some more background

After successfully learning how to execute a system call in Lesson 1 we now need to learn about one of the most important system calls in the kernel, sys_exit.

Notice how after our 'Hello, world!' program ran we got a Segmentation fault? Well, computer programs can be thought of as a long strip of instructions that are loaded into memory and divided up into sections (or segments). This general pool of memory is shared between all programs and can be used to store variables, instructions, other programs or anything really. Each segment is given an address so that information stored in that section can be found later.

To execute a program that is loaded in memory, we use the global label _start: to tell the operating system where in memory our program can be found and executed. Memory is then accessed sequentially following the program logic which determines the next address to be accessed. The kernel jumps to that address in memory and executes it.

It's important to tell the operating system exactly where it should begin execution and where it should stop. In Lesson 1 we didn't tell the kernel where to stop execution. So, after we called sys_write the program continued sequentially executing the next address in memory, which could have been anything. We don't know what the kernel tried to execute but it caused it to choke and terminate the process for us instead - leaving us the error message of 'Segmentation fault'. Calling sys_exit at the end of all our programs will mean the kernel knows exactly when to terminate the process and return memory back to the general pool thus avoiding an error.

Writing our program
sys_exit has a simple function definition. In the Linux System Call Table it is allocated OPCODE 60 and is passed a single argument through RDI.

In order to execute this function all we need to do is:

Load RDI with 0 to pass zero to the function meaning 'zero errors'.
Load RAX with 60 to call sys_exit.
Then request an interrupt on libc using syscall.
We then compile, link and run it again.

Note: Only new code added in each lesson will be commented.

```

    mov     rdi, 1
    mov     rax, 1
    syscall
 
    mov     rdi, 0      ; return 0 status on exit - 'No Errors'
    mov     rax, 60      ; invoke SYS_EXIT (kernel opcode 60)
    syscall

```
```
~$ nasm -f elf64 helloworld.asm
~$ ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld.o -o helloworld
~$ ./helloworld
Hello World!
```
## Lesson 3
Calculate string length

Firstly, some background

Why do we need to calculate the length of a string?

Well sys_write requires that we pass it a pointer to the string we want to output in memory and the length in bytes we want to print out. If we were to modify our message string we would have to update the length in bytes that we pass to sys_write as well, otherwise it will not print correctly.

You can see what I mean using the program in Lesson 2. Modify the message string to say 'Hello, brave new world!' then compile, link and run the new program. The output will be 'Hello, brave ' (the first 13 characters) because we are still only passing 13 bytes to sys_write as its length. It will be particularly necessary when we want to print out user input. As we won't know the length of the data when we compile our program, we will need a way to calculate the length at runtime in order to successfully print it out.

Writing our program

To calculate the length of the string we will use a technique called pointer arithmetic. Two registers are initialised pointing to the same address in memory. One register (in this case RAX) will be incremented forward one byte for each character in the output string until we reach the end of the string. The original pointer will then be subtracted from RAX. This is effectively like subtraction between two arrays and the result yields the number of elements between the two addresses. This result is then passed to sys_write replacing our hard coded count.

The CMP instruction compares the left hand side against the right hand side and sets a number of flags that are used for program flow. The flag we're checking is the ZF or Zero Flag. When the byte that RAX points to is equal to zero the ZF flag is set. We then use the JZ instruction to jump, if the ZF flag is set, to the point in our program labeled 'finished'. This is to break out of the nextchar loop and continue executing the rest of the program.

```

    mov     rdi, msg        ; move the address of our message string into RDI
    mov     rax, rdi        ; move the address in RDI into RAX as well (Both now point to the same segment in memory)
 
nextchar:
    cmp     byte [rax], 0   ; compare the byte pointed to by RAX at this address against zero (Zero is an end of string delimiter)
    jz      finished        ; jump (if the zero flagged has been set) to the point in the code labeled 'finished'
    inc     rax             ; increment the address in RAX by one byte (if the zero flagged has NOT been set)
    jmp     nextchar        ; jump to the point in the code labeled 'nextchar'
 
finished:
    sub     rax, rdi        ; subtract the address in RDI from the address in RAX
                            ; remember both registers started pointing to the same address (see line 15)
                            ; but RAX has been incremented one byte for each character in the message string
                            ; when you subtract one memory address from another of the same type
                            ; the result is number of segments between them - in this case the number of bytes

## Lesson 4 
Subroutines

Introduction to subroutines

Subroutines are functions. They are reusable pieces of code that can be called by your program to perform various repeatable tasks. Subroutines are declared using labels just like we've used before (eg. _start:) however we don't use the JMP instruction to get to them - instead we use a new instruction CALL. We also don't use the JMP instruction to return to our program after we have run the function. To return to our program from a subroutine we use the instruction RET instead.
Why don't we JMP to subroutines?

The great thing about writing a subroutine is that we can reuse it. If we want to be able to use the subroutine from anywhere in the code we would have to write some logic to determine where in the code we had jumped from and where we should jump back to. This would litter our code with unwanted labels. If we use CALL and RET however, assembly handles this problem for us using something called the stack.
Introduction to the stack

The stack is a special type of memory. It's the same type of memory that we've used before however it's special in how it is used by our program. The stack is what is call Last In First Out memory (LIFO). You can think of the stack like a stack of plates in your kitchen. The last plate you put on the stack is also the first plate you will take off the stack next time you use a plate.

The stack in assembly is not storing plates though, its storing values. You can store a lot of things on the stack such as variables, addresses or other programs. We need to use the stack when we call subroutines to temporarily store values that will be restored later.

Any register that your function needs to use should have it's current value put on the stack for safe keeping using the PUSH instruction. Then after the function has finished it's logic, these registers can have their original values restored using the POP instruction. This means that any values in the registers will be the same before and after you've called your function. If we take care of this in our subroutine we can call functions without worrying about what changes they're making to our registers.

The CALL and RET instructions also use the stack. When you CALL a subroutine, the address you called it from in your program is pushed onto the stack. This address is then popped off the stack by RET and the program jumps back to that place in your code. This is why you should always JMP to labels but you should CALL functions.

## Lesson 5 
External include files

External include files allow us to move code from our program and put it into separate files. This technique is useful for writing clean, easy to maintain programs. Reusable bits of code can be written as subroutines and stored in separate files called libraries. When you need a piece of logic you can include the file in your program and use it as if they are part of the same file.

In this lesson we will move our string length calculating subroutine into an external file. We fill also make our string printing logic and program exit logic a subroutine and we will move them into this external file. Once it's completed our actual program will be clean and easier to read.

We can then declare another message variable and call our print function twice in order to demonstrate how we can reuse code.

Note: I won't be showing the code in functions.asm after this lesson unless it changes. It will just be included if needed.

Hello, brave new world!
This is how we recycle in NASM.
This is how we recycle in NASM.
Error: Our second message is outputted twice. This is fixed in the next lesson. 
```

## Lesson 6 
NULL terminating bytes
Ok so why did our second message print twice when we only called our sprint function on msg2 once? Well actually it did only print once. You can see what I mean if you comment out our second call to sprint. The output will be both of our message strings.

But how is this possible?

What is happening is we weren't properly terminating our strings. In assembly, variables are stored one after another in memory so the last byte of our msg1 variable is right next to the first byte of our msg2 variable. We know our string length calculation is looking for a zero byte so unless our msg2 variable starts with a zero byte it keeps counting as if it's the same string (and as far as assembly is concerned it is the same string). So we need to put a zero byte or 0h after our strings to let assembly know where to stop counting.

Note: In programming 0h denotes a null byte and a null byte after a string tells assembly where it ends in memory.

```
## Lesson 7
Linefeeds

Linefeeds are essential to console programs like our 'hello world' program. They become even more important once we start building programs that require user input. But linefeeds can be a pain to maintain. Sometimes you will want to include them in your strings and sometimes you will want to remove them. If we continue to hard code them in our variables by adding 0Ah after our declared message text, it will become a problem. If there's a place in the code that we don't want to print out the linefeed for that variable we will need to write some extra logic remove it from the string at runtime.

It would be better for the maintainability of our program if we write a subroutine that will print out our message and then print a linefeed afterwards. That way we can just call this subroutine when we need the linefeed and call our current sprint subroutine when we don't.

A call to sys_write requires we pass a pointer to an address in memory of the string we want to print so we can't just pass a linefeed character (0Ah) to our print function. We also don't want to create another variable just to hold a linefeed character so we will instead use the stack.

The way it works is by moving a linefeed character into RAX. We then push RAX onto the stack and get the address pointed to by the Extended Stack Pointer. RSP is another register. When you push items onto the stack, RSP is decremented to point to the address in memory of the last item and so it can be used to access that item directly from the stack. Since RSP points to an address in memory of a character, sys_write will be able to use it to print.

## Lesson 8
Passing arguments

In x86 we used to be able to use ECX register as our counter for the loop. Although it's a general-purpose register it's original intention was to be used as a counter. Passing arguments to your program from the command line is as easy as popping them off the stack in NASM. When we run our program in x86, any passed arguments are loaded onto the stack in reverse order. The name of the program is then loaded onto the stack and lastly the total number of arguments is loaded onto the stack. The last two stack items for a NASM compiled program are always the name of the program and the number of passed arguments.

So in x86 all we have to do to use them is pop the number of arguments off the stack first, then iterate once for each argument and perform our logic. In our program that means calling our print function.

helloworld-args.asm
```
; Hello World Program (Passing arguments from the command line)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf64 helloworld-args.asm
; Link with: ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
; Run with: ./helloworld-args
 
%include        'functions.asm'
 
SECTION .text
global  _start
 
_start:
 
    pop     rcx             ; first value on the stack is the number of arguments
 
nextArg:
    cmp     rcx, 0h         ; check to see if we have any arguments left
    jz      noMoreArgs      ; if zero flag is set jump to noMoreArgs label (jumping over the end of the loop)
    pop     rax             ; pop the next argument off the stack
    call    sprintLF        ; call our print with linefeed function
    dec     rcx             ; decrease rcx (number of arguments left) by 1
    jmp     nextArg         ; jump to nextArg label
 
noMoreArgs:
    call    quit
```
```
~$ nasm -f elf64 helloworld-args.asm
~$ ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
~$ ./helloworld-args "This is one argument" "This is another" 101 
./helloworld-args
This is one argument
This is another 101
Error Segmentation Fault
```

If we were to compile the x86 version from Lesson 8 tutorial in asmtutor.com using the nasm -g option we could see the counter gets decremented correctly in GDB. As shown below we start with 3 in ECX. After continously clicking s to step in or n for next in Gdb eventually the program will exit. With ECX showing zero and no segmentation fault.

```
nasm -g -f elf helloworld-args.asm
ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
gdb --args ./helloworld-args "cars" "too"
break _start
run
s
info registers
```

![Image x86 register zero](assets/images/x86inforegzero.png)

Now if we go back to our 64-bit example and compile it with nasm -g option for debugging we get a segmentation fault. We can see that at first we have 3 in ecx. Our program even prints out the correct stuff. This is due to helloworld-args saving the rcx through pop rcx. However once we get into sprint our code uses a syscall which clobbers the rcx value with a random value. 

```
nasm -g -f elf64 helloworld-args.asm
ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
gdb --args ./helloworld-args "cars" "too"
break _start
run
n
info registers
```

Now that rcx has been clobbered the code will run even printing the right arguments. However the code will return back and never hit jz    noMoreArgs The reason being that it will think there are still more arguments left. eventually hitting a segmentation fault while in our functions.asm. [Click here to learn more about syscall clobber](https://peaku.co/questions/20070-%C2%BFcuando-linux-x86-64-syscall-clobber-%25r8%252C-%25r9-y-%25r10) What we know need to do is find a way to print the arguments without relying on RCX.

```
nasm -g -f elf64 helloworld-args.asm
ld -m elf_x86_64 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
gdb --args ./helloworld-args "cars" "too"
```
## Lesson 8-1
Passing arguments 64-bit style

Seeing that RCX won't work like we could do in x86 using ECX. We need to use a different technique to print out arguments.
